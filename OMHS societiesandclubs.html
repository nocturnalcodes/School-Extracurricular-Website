<p>Honors Societies and clubs allow students to be apart of another community outside of the classroom. Students get time to connect and strengthen their skills with others. Students use a higher level of thinking and can apply their skills to other aspects of their lives. A few clubs and honor societies students can take are:</p>

<ol style="font-size:160%; color:#D6CCB7; font-family:trebuchet ms;" type="i">
	<li>The National Honor Society</li>
	<li>The National Technical Society</li>
	<li>The Environmental Club</li>
	<li>The French Club</li>
</ol>

<p>The French Club for example teaches students an entire new perspective of world language. Students who take apart in this are recognized for their academic success and interest in certain topics.</p>
